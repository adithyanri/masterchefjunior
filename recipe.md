*1 cup sugar
*1/2 cup water
*1/4 teaspoon cardomom powder
*few saffron strands
*1/2 teaspoon lemon juice

*boil everything together*


*how to  prepare jalebi*

*in a large bowl mix together flour besan baking powder and baking soda

*add yogurt,cardamom powder and mix 

*add food color and water to form a flowing consistency of batter

*the batter should not be too thick or thin .you may need upto 3/4 water depending on the quality of flour

*cover the batter and let the batter sit for 10-12 hrs to ferment you  see small bubbles on the top of the batter when once it has fermented

*in the morning whisk the batter a little . you may need to add  little water if the batter looks too thick at this point

*meanwhile add sugar to a pan . add water and mix with sugar and let it all come to a boil

*once it comes to a boil add cardomom powder saffron strand and lemon juice

*let it simmer till syrup becomes sticky and and form a one string consistency.basically place a drop of syrup in between your thumb and index finger and then when you move your fingers away from each other it should form a single thread .

*if you  cant get consistency just make it sticky.keep the syrup warm while you make the jalebis

*transfer jalebi batter into a squeeze bottle .the one i used had a very small tip hence the thin jalebis

*meanwhile heat the oil or ghee in a pan or kadai . i used the combination of the two.keep the  heat at medium-low.

*squeeze the batter in hot oil , making spiral motion from inside to outside remember to keep at low heat else you wont be able to form the shape if the batter is dispersing in the oil maybe its too thin and you need to add some flour to it once you have made the spiral shape with the batter ,increase the heat to medium-high.

*fry till crisp from both sides .remove from oil and immedietly dip in warm sugar syrup ,few seconds on each side is good enough .

*remove jalebis from sugar syrup and transfer to a serving plate.enjoy homemade jalebi with milk or rabri you may garnish with some nuts on top
